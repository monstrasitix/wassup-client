# Wassup Client

Implementation of an offline architecture with React and conventional tooling. Serves to show
that light coupling between state and components can enhance offline experience.

Project is also experimenting with a SCSS based design system. Aiming to ignore CSS-in-JS in favor for transpilation for a broader reach and customization.
